About

    Instruction cards are a way to represent the functionality and inputs of a machine instruction/

    The instruction card syntax is simple and fairly straightforward. It supports a number of simple
    properties and limited conditional branching.

Properties
    @name "name"
        --  Registers the name of the instruction. 
    @brief "description"
        --  Registers a brief overview of the instruction. 
    @description "description"
        --  Registers the description of the instruction. 
    @show [reg]
        --  Specifies what registers should be displayed upon hovering over the instruction.
        --  'reg' can be a single register or a pair of two registers 'reg1:reg2'
        
        example:
            @show dx:ax, cx


Operators
    size(register)  
        -- returns the size of a given register

    argc
        -- the number of arguments in the argument array.

    args[]
        --  an array of arguments to the instruction. 
            For example, the instruction 'add ax, bx' would result in an argument array of [ax, bx]

Conditionals
    Properties can be changed, added, or omitted via the use of conditionals.

    For example:

    if size(args[0]) = 1 {
        @brief "Multiplies ax by {args[0]}."
    }
    elif(size(args[0] = 2)) {
        @brief "Multiplies dx:ax by {args[0]}."
    }
    else {

    }
